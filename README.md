A game written in Rust using `bevy` game engine. Nothing is ready so do not expect anything from it yet.

## Roadmap

## How to run the game

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Umatriz/element.git
cd element
# compile bevy as dynamic library and run the game (highly decreases compile time)
cargo run -F bevy/dynamic_linking
```
